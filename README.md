# Toxic-Comment-Classification
The objective was to design a model that detects and assigns multiple toxicity labels to mean or toxic comments on social media sites such as twitter. We designed and trained six models ranging from a Convolutional neural network to bi-directional LSTM (long short term memory) plus CNN network. For the word embedding’s we used GLOVE embedding.  The highest accuracy rate of 98.503% on test data was attained with a bi-directional LSTM plus CNN network. For experimenting and coding the models we used python with a Keras framework running on a TensorFlow backend. For training the models we made use of Google Colab Jupyter notebook which provides free GPU and TPU hardware.
